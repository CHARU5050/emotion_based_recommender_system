# Emotion Based Recommender System
This project introduces an Emotion-Based Recommender System (EBRS)
utilizing deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
and batch normalization, to enhance the personalization of recommendations by
incorporating users' emotional states. By capturing temporal dependencies in emotional
data from facial recognition, the proposed system adapts dynamically to users' changing
emotional states. The model is trained to discern intricate relationships between
emotional cues and user preferences, providing a context-aware and nuanced
recommendation process. Real-time emotional feedback further fine-tunes the
recommendation strategy, resulting in improved user satisfaction and engagement
compared to traditional recommender systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the Emotion-Based Recommender System, marking a significant stride
towards emotionally intelligent and personalized computing. 


## Tech Stack
Flask


## Installation

Install Python:
Flask requires Python to be installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: Python Downloads. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Open a Terminal/Command Prompt:
After installing Python, open a terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows).

Install Flask using pip:
Run the following command to install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask
```
If you are using Python 3, you might need to use pip3 instead of pip:
```bash
pip3 install Flask
```
Verify the Installation:
To verify that Flask has been installed successfully, you can check the installed version:
```bash
flask --version
```
Then run:
```bash
python app.py

```
